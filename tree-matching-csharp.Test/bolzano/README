The residential address data (Bolzano Address Trees) of the real world
experiment in Section 9.3 is owned by the Municipality of Bolzano and
was provided to the authors in the context of the eBZ Initiative. By
courtesy of the Municipality of Bolzano you may download the Bolzano
Address Trees under the following conditions:

   1. You use the data for research purpose only.
   2. You explicitly acknowledge the Municipality of Bolzano. 

The Bolzano Address Trees come in two text files (L.trees, R.trees)
encoded with braces. For example, 

30:{cesare abba strasse{1}{2}{3{{1}{3}}}{11}}

is the address tree with ID 30, its root node has the label "cesare
abba strasse" and the children of the root are labeled 1, 2, 3, 11; 3
has a child with an empty string label, which in turn has two children
with labels 1 and 3. The IDs of L.trees are aligned to R.trees by hand
such that matching address trees have the same ID. All street names
are lowercased.
